                <h3 id="taste">1. Taste of Her Love</h3>
                <p>Childhood was like a see saw it has its ups and downs. Since I was a kid my mom used to feed me with her hand which in Ethiopia is called Gursha .It is a way of showing compassion, love and sharing. This culture comes from ancient times and it is still used now. 
                </p>
                <p>Every night at dinner time I was always the one who complain to eat and it is not because I don’t love to eat it is just that I eat snacks around that time. So my mother often gets angry that I don’t eat dinner so she starts to give me some Gursha because she knows I cannot resist her loving hands.
                    And after a while it becomes our tradition. When she always eats she gave me and my brother a taste of her love. And the food always tastes better in her hands.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="times">2. Challenging Times</h3>
                    <p> But three years back my mother got sick and hospitalized. I remember her telling me over the phone that she was not coming home. She made it sound so simple for us to not worry over it but I have never felt that shocked in my life, I didn’t know how to feel I just froze there and tried to think any positive thing I can think of. I said to myself “she will be back.” over and over. For a moment there it calmed me down then I called my brother to tell him what she told me. 
                    He was very sad but I managed to make him calm. That night I didn’t sleep at all. I was praying to God to help my mama come home.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="reality">3. The New Reality</h3>
                   <p>
                   Days pass and she was still in the hospital. We only got to visit her on Saturday’s because of school. Every night at dinner I missed her Gursha. Every morning when I woke up I missed her kisses. I even missed her anger. I was very sad that my grades were lacking and when I got home I stopped studying. I lost the sense of life. And above all this the most thing it broke my heart was she didn’t live life the fullest because she was taking care of me and my brother. 
                   She is a single mother due to the death of my father when she was pregnant with me. She gave up her life for us. </p>
                   <p>So when I saw her in the hospital on that bed I promised myself I would make her happy for every minute that she have and I will live my life to the fullest with no regrets. So I started to study, smile, and go out exploring nature and I felt free of every duty like school, studying and exploring because now I enjoyed learning because I saw where I want to be in the future.</p>
                   <p>
                   Weeks changed to month and she was getting better. I visited her every Saturday and tell her what I did the whole week: my assignments, my grades, which new places I visited, what new song I loved and she closed her eyes like she was imagining it . I saw her smile looking at me and I was happy. That moment was unforgettable.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                   “One month and two weeks she has been away and today she is coming home. Today I will be with her. Today she will give me Gursha. After all this time, I will have the taste of her love.”
