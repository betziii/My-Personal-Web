        <h2>My Love For Rock Not The Stone</h2>
        <p>I was introduced to rock music at the age of thirteen by my cousin who loves to listen to it.
            The first song I have ever listened was In the end by Linkin Park which was pretty much famous at that time. 
            She gave me some rock songs and I started to love it. This love developed into my personality. </p>
            <p>The beautiful base, the drums but most of all the unique voices of the singers is a beautiful harmony that gives me peace. 
            I believe rock music is a beautiful music that anyone can listen to feel uplifted.</p>
           <p>Rock music has its own classifications like classic, heavy metal, metallic and it has types like punk rock or gothic rock. But I am a big fan of the classic rocks which are the old 90th and way back. The smooth settled voice flows slowly with the base into my ears and it feels like I am alone in this wide world. It is a form of freedom rebellion, and a sense of calmness. For me, every rock music I listen to have a connection with a bit of my anger, 
               It is sad that rock music listened only by limited people but I deem rock music expresses the deep thoughts everyone thinks about now and then. 
               So, anyone can relate to it.</p>
           <p>Sometimes I struggle to study because I want to listen to rock but now I have manage to study without it. If opportunities knock on my door and present me with a chance of learning musical instruments I am sure I will choose the base guitar and the cello. 
               The beauty and deepness of their sound is extraordinary.</p>
           <p>To listen to rock people should not feel like a rebel, punk or Goth, it is just a beautiful music that can be related to anyone with any type of lifestyle.</p>
