                    <p>My love for movies came from my brother i assume. He is a big movie lover and since I grew up with him, it rubbrd off. I have great admiration for classic movies which are taken from old books. those movies are so passionnate, beautiful and powerful to make you feel emotions. Some examples are Anne Kerenina,
                         Pride and Prejudice which are one of the best books and movies.</p>
                        <p>Of course, I am also a big fun of science fictions. Marvel universe never dissapoints. and I love comedy movies and series.</p>
                        <p>Form childhood I have had a deep love for music. What makes mine different from our social norm is the fact that Rock music is seen as a devil song. I know that all music are seen as the work of devil but i see a person trying to get by one day at a time in his/her life and music is an outlet to help himself and other people that feels like them. You see the pain, the love, the sorrow, the happiness, the rebellion or the cruel reality that everyone seems to forget.
                             I believe it could show us the diffrent side of life.</p>
                        <p>My all time favorites are: You found me by The Fray, Bohiemian Rapsody by queen, Boulovard of Broken Dreams by Greenday are some of the best.</p>
